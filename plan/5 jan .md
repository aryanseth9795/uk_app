 user will get notify when it add to cart a product through product card , as well as check out address selection , it have some bug. 

 my plan is 
 1. user is new and not logged in then it will show login first at cart page. 
 2. user is logged in but not added any address then it will show add address first at cart page. 
 3. user is logged in and have a address then at address will automatically selected and user have option to change address. which route to manage address screen.
 4. user can have only one primary address so rather using switch we can use radio button to select primary address at manage address screen.
